					<h2>X-ray identification of galaxy cluster</h2>
		
					<p> We detect 944 clusters with X-ray data from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), and create a new X-ray selected catalog of 
						extended galaxy clusters from the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS), using a dedicated source 
						detection and characterization algorithm optimized for extended sources. The whole RXGCC catalog is available 
						at <a href="https://github.com/wwxu/rxgcc.github.io/blob/master/table_rxgcc.fits"> here</a>. The multiple bands information
						for each RXGCC cluster are listed <a href="https://github.com/wwxu/rxgcc.github.io"> here</a>. (Xu ea. 2021b, Xu ea. 2018)

					<h2><em>gglens</em> of massive halos</h2>
						<p> We report the measurement of halo c-M relation with galaxy-galaxy
							lensing method, using shear catalog of the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) Data Release
							8, which covers a sky area of 9500 deg2. The foreground lenses are selected from redMaPPer, LOWZ,
							and CMASS catalogs. We fit the measured c-M relation, and find an upturn is favored over a simple power-law model. 
							Our measurement provides important information for the recent argument of massive cluster formation process. (Xu ea. 2021a)

					<h2>Optical identification galaxy clusters</h2>

					<p> We present an efficient method for detecting galaxy clusters by combining the WISE data with 
						SuperCOSMOS and 2MASS data. After performing star-galaxy separation, we calculate the 
						number of companion galaxies around the galaxies with photometric redshifts previously 
						estimated by the SuperCOSMOS, 2MASS and WISE data. A scaled richness Rscal >=􏰊 30 is set as 
						a criterion to identify clusters. From a sky area of 275 deg2 of the Sloan Digital Sky 
						Survey Stripe 82 region, we identify 302 clusters in the redshift range of 0.1 < z < 0.35, 247 
						(82%) of which are previously known SDSS clusters. (Xu ea. 2014)

					<h2>X-ray spectra analysis of AGN</h2>
		<p>We report the detection of Kα lines of neutral Si, S, Ar, Ca, Cr, and Mn, along with the prominent Fe Kα, Fe Kβ, and Ni Kα lines, 
			from the deep Chandra observation of the low-luminosity Compton-thick AGN in M51. 
			The hard X-ray continuum of M51 from Chandra and NuSTAR confirms the Compton-thick nature of the nucleus of M51. (Xu ea. 2015)
